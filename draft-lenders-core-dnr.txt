1.  Introduction

   [RFC9461], [RFC9462] and [RFC9463] introduced ways to discover the
   encrypted DNS configuration of resolvers, both over DNS and in a
   local network using Router Advertisements or DHCP.  They use SVCB
   records or their SvcParams definitions to carry the information on a
   resolver.  However, so far only DNS transfer protocols based on
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) were accounted for, namely DNS over
   TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], and DNS over
   Dedicated QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250].  This document aims to bridge this
   gap for DNS over CoAP (DoC) [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap].

   DoC provides a solution for encrypted DNS in constrained
   environments, i.e., where the usage of DoT, DoH, DoQ or similar TLS-
   based solutions typically are not possible.  The Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252], the transfer protocol for DoC,
   is mostly agnostic to the transport layer, i.e., it can be
   transported over UDP, TCP, or WebSockets [RFC8323], and even more
   obscure transports such as Bluetooth GATT
   [I-D.amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt] or SMS [lwm2m] are discussed.  CoAP
   comes with 3 security modes that would need to be covered by the
   SvcParams:

   *  *No Security:* No encryption, just plain CoAP.  While not
      recommended with [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap], this mode provides
      CoAP features, otherwise not present in classic DNS over UDP, such
      as block-wise transfer [RFC7959] for datagram-based segmentation.

   *  *Transport Security:* CoAP may use DTLS for when transferred over
      UDP [RFC7252] and TLS when transferred over TCP [RFC8323].

   *  *Object Security:* Application-layer based object encryption
      within CoAP based on OSCORE [RFC8613].  OSCORE can be either used
      as an alternative or in addition to transport security.

      OSCORE keys are not usable indefinitely and need to be set up, for
      example through an EDHOC key exchange
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc], which may use credentials from
      trusted ACE Authorization Server (AS) as described in the ACE
      EDHOC profile [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].  As an
      alternative to EDHOC, keys can be set up by such an AS as
      described in the ACE OSCORE profile [RFC9203].

   For a DoC server to be discoverable via Discovery of Designated
   Resolvers (DDR) [RFC9462] and Discovery of Network-designated
   Resolvers (DNR) [RFC9463], both transfer protocol and type and
   parameters for the security parameter need to be provided in the
   SvcParams field of these mechanisms, which this document will
   discuss.

2.  Terminology

   The terms “DoC server” and “DoC client” are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap].

   The terms “constrained node” and "constrained network" are used as
   defined in [RFC7228].

   SvcParams denotes the field in either DNS SVCB/HTTPS records as
   defined in [RFC9460], or DHCP and RA messages as defined in
   [RFC9463].  SvcParamKeys are used as defined in [RFC9460].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Problem Space

   The first and most important question to ask for the discoverability
   of DoC resolvers is if and what new SvcParamKeys need to be defined.

   [RFC9460] defines the “alpn” key, which is used to identify the
   protocol suite of a service binding using its Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ID [RFC7301].  While this is useful to
   identify classic transport layer security, the question is raised if
   this is needed or even helpful for when there is only object
   security.  There is an ALPN ID for CoAP over TLS that was defined in
   [RFC8323] but it is not advisable to use the same ALPN ID for CoAP
   over DTLS.  Object security may be selected in addition to transport
   layer security, so defining an ALPN ID for each combination might not
   be viable or scalable.  For some ways of setting up object security,
   additional information is needed for the establishment of an
   encryption context and for authentication with an authentication
   server (AS).  Orthogonally to the security mechanism, the transfer
   protocol needs to be established.

   Beyond the SvcParamKeys, there is the question of what the field
   values of the Encrypted DNS Options defined in [RFC9463] might be
   with EDHOC or ACE EDHOC.  While most fields map, “authentication-
   domain-name” (ADN) and its corresponding ADN length field may not
   matter in ACE driven cases.

   Out of scope of this document are related issues adjacent to its
   problem space. they are listed both for conceptual delimitation, and
   to aid in discussion of more comprehensive solutions:

   *  There is ongoing work in addressing the trouble created by CoAP
      using a diverse set of URI schemes in the shape of coap+..., such
      as coap+tcp [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication].  The creation of
      URI authority values that express the content of SVCB records
      together with IP literals is part of the solution space that will
      be explored there.

   *  Route Advertisements (RAs) as used in [RFC9463] can easily exceed
      the link layer fragmentation threshold of constrained networks.
      The presence of DNR information in an RA can contribute to that
      issue.

4.  Solution Sketches

   To answer the raised questions, we first look at the general case
   then 4 base scenarios, from which other scenarios might be a
   combination of:

   *  Unencrypted DoC,

   *  DoC over TLS/DTLS,

   *  DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC, and

   *  DoC over OSCORE using ACE-EDHOC.

   In the general case, we mostly need to answer the question for
   additional SvcParamKeys.  [RFC9460] defines the keys “mandatory”,
   “alpn”, “no-default-alpn”, “port”, “ipv4hint”, and “ipv6hint” were
   defined.  Additionally, [RFC9461] defines “dohpath” which carries the
   URI template for the DNS resource at the DoH server in relative form.

   For DoC, the DNS resource needs to be identified as, so a
   corresponding “docpath” key should be provided that provides either a
   relative URI or CRI [I-D.ietf-core-href].  Since the URI-Path option
   in CoAP may be omitted (defaulting to the root path), this could also
   be done for the “docpath”.

4.1.  Unencrypted DoC

   While unencrypted DoC is not recommended by
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap] and might not even be viable using DDR/
   DNR, it provides additional benefits not provided by classic
   unencrypted DNS over UDP, such as segmentation block-wise transfer
   [RFC7959].  However, it provides the simplest DoC configuration and
   thus is here discussed.

   At minimum for a DoC server a way to identify the following keys are
   required. “docpath” (see above), an optional “port” (see [RFC9460]),
   the IP address (either with an optional “ipv6hint”/“ipv4hint” or the
   respective IP address field in [RFC9463]), and a yet to be defined
   SvcParamKey for the CoAP transfer protocol, e.g., “coaptransfer”. The
   latter can be used to identify the service binding as a CoAP service
   binding.

   The “authenticator-domain-name” field should remain empty as it does
   not serve a purpose without encryption.

   See this example for the possible values of a DNR option:

   authenticator-domain-name: ""
   ipv6-address: <DoC server address>
   svc-params:
    - coaptransfer="tcp"
    - docpath="/dns"
    - port=61616

4.2.  DoC over TLS/DTLS

   In addition to the SvcParamKeys proposed in Section 4.1, this
   scenario needs the “alpn” key.  While there is a “coap” ALPN ID
   defined, it only identifies CoAP over TLS [RFC8323].  As such, a new
   ALPN ID for CoAP over DTLS is required.

   See this example for the possible values of a DNR option:

   authenticator-domain-name: "dns.example.com"
   ipv6-address: <DoC server address>
   svc-params:
    - alpn="co" /*TBD*/
    - docpath="/dns"

   Note that “coaptransfer” is not needed, as it is implied by the ALPN
   ID; thus, no values for it would be allocated for transfer protocols
   that use transport security.

4.3.  DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC

   While the “alpn” SvcParamKey is needed for the transport layer
   security (see Section 4.2), we can implement a CA-style
   authentication with EDHOC when using object security with OSCORE
   using the authenticator-domain-name field.

   A new key SvcParamKey “objectsecurity” identifies the type of object
   security, using the value "edhoc" in this scenario.

   See this example for the possible values of a DNR option:

   authenticator-domain-name: "dns.example.com"
   ipv6-address: <DoC server address>
   svc-params:
    - coaptransfer="udp",
    - objectsecurity="edhoc",
    - docpath="/dns",
    - port=61616

   The use of objectsecurity="edhoc" with an authenticator-domain-name
   and no further ACE details indicates that the client can use CA based
   authentication of the server.

4.4.  DoC over ACE-OSCORE

   Using ACE, we require an OAuth context to authenticate the server in
   addition to the “objectsecurity” key.  We propose three keys “oauth-
   aud” for the audience, “oauth-scope” for the OAuth scope, and “auth-
   as” for the authentication server. “oauth-aud” should be the valid
   domain name of the DoC server, “oauth-scope” a list of identifiers
   for the scope, and “oauth-as” a valid URI or CRI.

   TBD: should oauth-scope be expressed at all?

   Since authentication is done over OAuth and not CA-style, the
   “authenticator-domain-name” is not needed.  There might be merit,
   however, to use it instead of the “oauth-aud” SvcParamKey.

   See this example for the possible values of a DNR option:

   authenticator-domain-name: ""
   ipv6-address: <DoC server address>
   svc-params:
    - coaptransfer="tcp"
    - objectsecurity="edhoc" /* TBD: or ace-edhoc? */
    - docpath="/dns",
    - port=61616,
    - oauth-aud="dns.example.com",
    - oauth-scope="resolve DNS"
    - oauth-as="coap://as.example.com"
