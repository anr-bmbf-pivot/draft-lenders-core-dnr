Abstract

   This document states problems when designing DNS SVCB records to
   discover endpoints that communicate over Object Security for
   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) [RFC8613].  As a
   consequence of learning about OSCORE, this discovery will allow a
   host to learn both CoAP servers and DNS over CoAP resolvers that use
   OSCORE to encrypt messages and Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE
   (EDHOC) [RFC9528] for key exchange.  Challenges arise because SVCB
   records are not meant to be used to exchange security contexts, which
   is required in OSCORE scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   The discovery of Internet services can be facilitated by the Domain
   Name System (DNS).  To discover services of the constrained Internet
   of Things (IoT) using the DNS, two challenges must be solved.  First,
   the discovery of a DNS resolver that supports DNS resolution based on
   secure, IoT-friendly protocols—otherwise the subsequent discovery of
   IoT-tailored services would be limited to resolution protocols
   conflicting with constrained resources.  Second, the discovery of an
   IoT-friendly service beyond the DNS resolution.

   [RFC9460] specifies the "SVCB" ("Service Binding") DNS resource
   record to lookup information needed to connect to a network service.
   Service Parameters (SvcParams) carry that information within the SVCB
   record.

   The discovery of DNS resolvers can be enabled by the DNS itself
   [RFC9461], [RFC9462] or, in a local network, by Router Advertisements
   and DHCP [RFC9463].  In all theses cases, the SvcParams is used, but
   supports only DNS transfer based on Transport Layer Security (TLS),
   namely DNS over TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484],
   and DNS over Dedicated QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250].  The use of DoT, DoH, or
   DoQ, however, is not recommended in IoT scenarios.

   DNS over CoAP [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap] provides a solution for
   encrypted DNS in constrained environments.  The Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] is mostly agnostic to the
   transport layer CoAP can be transported over UDP, TCP, or WebSockets
   [RFC8323], and even less common transports such as Bluetooth GATT
   [I-D.amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt] or SMS [lwm2m] are discussed.
   [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication] covers the selection of
   different CoAP transports using SVCB records.

   CoAP offers three security modes:

   *  *No Security:* This plain CoAP mode does not support any
      encryption.  It is not recommended when using
      [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap] but inherits core CoAP features such
      as block-wise transfer [RFC7959] for datagram-based segmentation.
      Such features are beneficial in constrained settings even without
      encryption.

   *  *Transport Security:* CoAP may use DTLS when transferred over UDP
      [RFC7252] and TLS when transferred over TCP [RFC8323].

   *  *Object Security:* Securing content objects can be achieved using
      OSCORE [RFC8613].  OSCORE can be used either as an alternative or
      in addition to transport security.

      OSCORE keys have a limited lifetime and need to be set up.  Keys
      can be established through an EDHOC key exchange [RFC9528],
      received from an ACE Authorization Server (AS, as described in the
      ACE OSCORE profile [RFC9203]), or through a combination of those
      (established with an EDHOC peer whose public key is confirmed by
      an AS, using the ACE EDHOC profile
      [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile]).

   The SVCB-based discovery of a CoAP service in mode "no security" is
   covered in [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication], and a CoAP service
   in the mode "transport security" in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-dtls-alpn].
   The discovery of CoAP services in mode "object security" is not
   specified.  To guide future specifications, this document clarifies
   aspects when using SVCB in the context of CoAP and object security.

2.  Terminology

   The terms "DoC server" and "DoC client" are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap].

   The terms "constrained node" and "constrained network" are used as
   defined in [RFC7228].

   SvcParams denotes the field in either DNS SVCB/HTTPS records as
   defined in [RFC9460], or DHCP and RA messages as defined in
   [RFC9463].  SvcParamKeys are used as defined in [RFC9460].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Problem Space

   The first and most important point of discussion for the
   discoverability of CoAP is if and what new SvcParamKeys need to be
   defined and what is already there.

   [RFC9460] defines the "alpn" key, which is used to identify the
   protocol suite of a service binding using its Application-Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ID [RFC7301].  While this is useful to
   identify classic transport layer security, the question is raised if
   this is needed or even helpful for when there is only object
   security.  There is an ALPN ID for CoAP over TLS that is defined in
   [RFC8323].  As using the same ALPN ID for different transport layers
   is not recommended, another ALPN ID for CoAP over DTLS is introduced
   in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-dtls-alpn].  Object security may be selected
   in addition to transport layer security or without it.  Additionally,
   different CoAP transports can be selected, which may be orthogonal to
   the transport security.  For instance, DTLS can be used over
   transports other than UDP.  The selection of CoAP transport protocols
   will be covered in future versions of
   [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication].  Defining an ALPN ID for each
   combination of object security, mode of transport layer security, and
   transport protocol might not be viable or scalable.  For some ways of
   setting up object security, additional information is needed, such as
   an establishment options for an encryption context with EDHOC or an
   authentication server (AS) with ACE.

   Beyond the SvcParamKeys, there is the question of what the field
   values of the Encrypted DNS Options defined in [RFC9463] might be
   with EDHOC or ACE EDHOC.  While most fields map, "authentication-
   domain-name" (ADN) and its corresponding ADN length field may not
   matter when authentication is driven by Authorization for Constrained
   Environments (ACE) [RFC9203] [I-D.ietf-ace-edhoc-oscore-profile].

4.  Objectives

   SVCB records are not meant and should not be used to exchange
   security contexts, so this eliminates scenarios that use pre-shared
   keys with OSCORE.  This leaves 2 base scenarios for OSCORE, which may
   occur in combination, with scenarios using transport security, or
   alternative transport protocols:

   *  DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC, and

   *  DoC using any ACE profile that eventually produces an OSCORE
      context.

   We mostly need to answer the question for additional SvcParamKeys.
   [RFC9460] defines the keys "mandatory", "alpn", "no-default-alpn",
   "port", "ipv4hint", and "ipv6hint".  Additionally,
   [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap] defines "docpath" which carries the
   path for the DNS resource at the DoC server as a CBOR sequence.

   Since "alpn" is needed for transport layer security, the type of
   object security (OSCORE using EDHOC, OSCORE using ACE, OSCORE using
   EDHOC using ACE), needs to be conveyed in a different SvcParamKey.
   The semantics and necessacity of the authenticator-domain-name field
   in [RFC9463] needs to be evaluated in each case.

   When using ACE, more SvcParamKeys might be needed, such as the OAuth
   audience, the scope or the authentication server URI.

   Defining these SvcParamKeys, including their value formats and
   spaces, as well as the behavior definition for authenticator-domain-
   name field, shall be part of future work.

4.1.  Scenarios

   Two example scenarios illustrate possible ways for which a solution
   should work; they are phrased in dialogue form rather than in terms
   of protocol elements to avoid bias on solutions.

4.1.1.  Neighbor discovered server with EDHOC credential

   In which the DoC server restricts access by network address (or not
   at all), and the client trusts its router to advertise a suitable
   Encrypted DNS server.

   1.  Client: Joins a network.

   2.  Local router: Sends out an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) with
       Encrypted DNS option (see Section 6 of [RFC9463]).

       Next to the network address, this conveys Service Parameters
       indicating DoC as well as a CWT Claims Set (CCS, [RFC8392]) that
       is to be used as an EDHOC credential.

   3.  Client starts EDHOC with the server at the indicated address.
       The client uses an ephemeral identity (i.e., authenticates with a
       CCS by value) and verifies that the DoC server is in possession
       of the key indicated in the CCS without explicit transmission of
       the CCS.

4.1.2.  DHCP discovered server with ACE details

   In which both the DoC client and server have a preconfigured security
   association with an ACE server, and trust no one else.

   1.  Client: Requests an address using DHCP

   2.  DHCP server: Offers an address along with the DHCPv6 Encrypted
       DNS Option (see Section 5 of [RFC9463]).

       The option contains an address as well as an indication that ACE
       is used, along with sufficient data for the client to obtain an
       ACE token.

       This includes hints like the ACE Request Creation hints: the
       address of the AS and an identifier of the DoC server understood
       by the AS (the "aud"ience).  The address of the AS should be
       provided in some resolved form, given that DNS is being
       bootstrapped.

   3.  Client requests token from AS:

       "I need a token for a host that is authorized to be my DNS server
       with me being authorized to use it; these hints were presented
       for me to obtain it."

   4.  AS verifies that the hint represents a recognized DNS server,
       that the client is authorized to use it, and issues a token for a
       suitable ACE profile (e.g. ACE OSCORE profile or ACE EDHOC
       profile).

   5.  Client establishes a security context with the DoC server as per
       the profile.
