1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

1.1.  Problems

   TODO transform into sentences:

   *  What do we need to find DoC using SvcParams [RFC9460] [RFC9463]?

   *  Do we need sepcific ALPNs?

      -  What should the fields in [RFC9463] RA / DHCP options give us?
         (authentication-domain-name may not matter in EDHOC/ACE-OSCORE
         setup, but audience value for ACE authorization server and the
         servers address might)

   *  How do we signal ALPN-equivalent information when there is not
      “the one” transport layer security?

   *  Can we indicate the transport (CoAP over UDP/TCP/etc.)
      orthogonally from (object) security mechanism (EDHOC, ACE-OSCORE,
      ...)

   *  TBD but might be out-of-scope:

      -  replace coap+... URI schemas with hostname literals

      -  Increased RA size / fragmentation

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Solution Sketches

   What should the fields in RA / DHCP option give us?

3.1.  Unencrypted DoC

   TBD: Does DNR allow it?

   authenticator-domain-name:
       (I'm leaving it empty b/c there is no use for it)
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616

3.2.  DoC over DTLS

   TBD: - Not even a problem, just register the relevant ALPN. - Trigger
   in CoRE, should be separate ALPN to “coap” (CoAP over TLS) ... and
   bikeshed value “co”, “COAP”, “cod”, ... - docpath if not given = ""
   (cmp.  URI-Path option in CoAP)?  > a la ‘When using the SVCB method
   for obtaining a DoC server (eg. because querying _dns or > because it
   comes in DNR), the server MUST set docpath unless it is empty, in
   which case the > client MUST assume docpath=“”’ to avoid implying an
   empty docpath even in places where no DoC is > done

   authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params: alpn="cod"/*TBD*/,docpath="/dns"

3.3.  DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC

   *  In a “web-browser style” (tell the device which name to
      authenticate, and it’ll do the cert validation)

   authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
   ipv6-address: ...

   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
       objectsecurity="edhoc",
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616

3.4.  DoC over ACE-OSCORE

   *  ACE to authenticate server (not necessarily the client)

   authenticator-domain-name:
       (leaving empty b/c there is no use for it)
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp" /* encoded as a numeric value */,
       objectsecurity="edhoc"/* or ace-edhoc?, also encoded as a numeric value */,
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616,
       oauth-aud="dns.example.com",
       oauth-scope="resolve DNS"/* should this be expressed at all? */,
       oauth-as="coap://as.example.com" /* encoded as a CRI? */

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
