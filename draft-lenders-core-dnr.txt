1.  Introduction

   [RFC9461], [RFC9462] and [RFC9463] introduced ways to discover the
   encrypted DNS configuration of resolvers, both over DNS and in a
   local network using Router Advertisements or DHCP.  They use SVCB
   records or their svcParam definitions to carry the information on a
   resolver.  However, so far only DNS transfer protocols based on
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) were accounted for, namely DNS over
   TLS (DoT) [RFC7858], DNS over HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], and DNS over
   Dedicated QUIC (DoQ) [RFC9250].  This document aims to bridge this
   gap for DNS over CoAP (DoC) [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap].

   DoC provides a solution for encrypted DNS in constrained
   environments, i.e., where the usage of DoT, DoH, DoQ or similar TLS-
   based solutions typically are not possible.  The Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252], the transfer protocol for DoC,
   is mostly agnostic to the transport layer, i.e., it can be
   transported over UDP, TCP, or WebSockets [RFC8323], and even more
   obscure transport such as Bluetooth GATT
   [I-D.amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt] or SMS [tbd-citation] are
   discussed.  CoAP comes with 3 security modes that would need to be
   covered by the SvcParams: - *No Security:* No encryption, just plain
   CoAP.  While not recommended with [I-D.ietf-core-dns-over-coap], this
   mode provides CoAP features, otherwise not present in classic DNS
   over UDP, such as block-wise transfer [RFC7959] for datagram-based
   segmentation. - *Transport Security:* CoAP may use DTLS for when
   transfered over UDP [RFC7252] and TLS when transfered over TCP
   [RFC8323]. - *Object Security:* Application-layer based object
   encryption within CoAP based on OSCORE [RFC8613].  OSCORE can be
   either used as an alternative or in addition to transport security.
   EDHOC [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] is used to establish the
   encryption context between two hosts and OSCORE-ACE [citation?] can
   be used for authentication of a server.

1.1.  Problems

   TODO transform into sentences:

   *  What do we need to find DoC using SvcParams [RFC9460] [RFC9463]?

   *  Do we need sepcific ALPNs?

      -  What should the fields in [RFC9463] RA / DHCP options give us?
         (authentication-domain-name may not matter in EDHOC/ACE-OSCORE
         setup, but audience value for ACE authorization server and the
         servers address might)

   *  How do we signal ALPN-equivalent information when there is not
      “the one” transport layer security?

   *  Can we indicate the transport (CoAP over UDP/TCP/etc.)
      orthogonally from (object) security mechanism (EDHOC, ACE-OSCORE,
      ...)

   *  TBD but might be out-of-scope:

      -  replace coap+... URI schemas with hostname literals

      -  Increased RA size / fragmentation

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Solution Sketches

   What should the fields in RA / DHCP option give us?

3.1.  Unencrypted DoC

   TBD: Does DNR allow it?

   authenticator-domain-name:
       (I'm leaving it empty b/c there is no use for it)
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616

3.2.  DoC over DTLS

   TBD:

   *  Not even a problem, just register the relevant ALPN.

   *  Trigger in CoRE, should be separate ALPN to “coap” (CoAP over TLS)
      ... and bikeshed value “co”, “COAP”, “cod”, ...

   *  docpath if not given = "" (cmp.  URI-Path option in CoAP)?

         a la ‘When using the SVCB method for obtaining a DoC server
         (eg. because querying _dns or because it comes in DNR), the
         server MUST set docpath unless it is empty, in which case the
         client MUST assume docpath=“”’ to avoid implying an empty
         docpath even in places where no DoC is done

   authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params: alpn="cod"/*TBD*/,docpath="/dns"

3.3.  DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC

   *  In a “web-browser style” (tell the device which name to
      authenticate, and it’ll do the cert validation)

   authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
   ipv6-address: ...

   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
       objectsecurity="edhoc",
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616

3.4.  DoC over ACE-OSCORE

   *  ACE to authenticate server (not necessarily the client)

   authenticator-domain-name:
       (leaving empty b/c there is no use for it)
   ipv6-address: ...
   svcb-params:
       coaptransport="coap-over-tcp" /* encoded as a numeric value */,
       objectsecurity="edhoc"/* or ace-edhoc?, also encoded as a numeric value */,
       docpath="/dns",
       port=61616,
       oauth-aud="dns.example.com",
       oauth-scope="resolve DNS"/* should this be expressed at all? */,
       oauth-as="coap://as.example.com" /* encoded as a CRI? */
