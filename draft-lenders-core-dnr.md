# Introduction

{{-svcb-for-dns}}, {{-ddr}} and {{-dnr}} introduced ways to discover the encrypted DNS configuration
of resolvers, both over DNS and in a local network using Router Advertisements or DHCP.
They use SVCB records or their svcParam definitions to carry the information on a resolver.
However, so far only DNS transfer protocols based on Transport Layer Security (TLS) were accounted
for, namely DNS over TLS (DoT) {{-dot}}, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) {{-doh}}, and DNS over Dedicated QUIC
(DoQ) {{-doq}}. This document aims to bridge this gap for DNS over CoAP (DoC) {{-doc}}.

DoC provides a solution for encrypted DNS in constrained environments, i.e., where the usage of DoT,
DoH, DoQ or similar TLS-based solutions typically are not possible.
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) {{-coap}}, the transfer protocol for DoC, is mostly
agnostic to the transport layer, i.e., it can be transported over UDP, TCP, or WebSockets
{{-coap-tcp}}, and even more obscure transport such as Bluetooth GATT {{-coap-gatt}} or SMS
{{lwm2m}} are discussed.
CoAP comes with 3 security modes that would need to be covered by the SvcParams:

- **No Security:** No encryption, just plain CoAP. While not recommended with {{-doc}}, this mode
  provides CoAP features, otherwise not present in classic DNS over UDP, such as
  block-wise transfer {{-coap-block}} for datagram-based segmentation.
- **Transport Security:** CoAP may use DTLS for when transfered over UDP {{-coap}} and TLS when
  transfered over TCP {{-coap-tcp}}.
- **Object Security:** Application-layer based object encryption within CoAP based on OSCORE
  {{-oscore}}. OSCORE can be either used as an alternative or in addition to transport security.
  EDHOC {{-edhoc}} is used to establish the encryption context between two hosts and OSCORE-ACE
  [citation?] can be used for authentication of a server.

## Problems

TODO transform into sentences:

- What do we need to find DoC using SvcParams {{-svcb}} {{-dnr}}?
- Do we need sepcific ALPNs?
    - What should the fields in {{-dnr}} RA / DHCP options give us?
      (authentication-domain-name may not matter in EDHOC/ACE-OSCORE setup, but audience value for
      ACE authorization server and the servers address might)
- How do we signal ALPN-equivalent information when there is not “the one” transport layer security?
- Can we indicate the transport (CoAP over UDP/TCP/etc.) orthogonally from (object) security mechanism (EDHOC, ACE-OSCORE, ...)
- TBD but might be out-of-scope:
    - replace coap+... URI schemas with hostname literals
    - Increased RA size / fragmentation

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Solution Sketches

What should the fields in RA / DHCP option give us?

## Unencrypted DoC
TBD: Does DNR allow it?

~~~~~~~~
authenticator-domain-name:
    (I'm leaving it empty b/c there is no use for it)
ipv6-address: ...
svcb-params:
    coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
    docpath="/dns",
    port=61616
~~~~~~~~

## DoC over DTLS
TBD:

- Not even a problem, just register the relevant ALPN.
- Trigger in CoRE, should be separate ALPN to “coap” (CoAP over TLS) ... and bikeshed value “co”, “COAP”, “cod”, ...
- `docpath` if not given = `""` (cmp. URI-Path option in CoAP)?

  > a la ‘When using the SVCB method for obtaining a DoC server (eg. because querying _dns or
  > because it comes in DNR), the server MUST set docpath unless it is empty, in which case the
  > client MUST assume docpath=“”’ to avoid implying an empty docpath even in places where no DoC is
  > done

~~~~~~~~
authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
ipv6-address: ...
svcb-params: alpn="cod"/*TBD*/,docpath="/dns"
~~~~~~~~


## DoC over OSCORE using EDHOC
- In a “web-browser style” (tell the device which name to authenticate, and it’ll do the cert
  validation)

~~~~~~~~
authenticator-domain-name: dns.example.com
ipv6-address: ...

svcb-params:
    coaptransport="coap-over-tcp",
    objectsecurity="edhoc",
    docpath="/dns",
    port=61616
~~~~~~~~

## DoC over ACE-OSCORE
- ACE to authenticate server (not necessarily the client)

~~~~~~~~
authenticator-domain-name:
    (leaving empty b/c there is no use for it)
ipv6-address: ...
svcb-params:
    coaptransport="coap-over-tcp" /* encoded as a numeric value */,
    objectsecurity="edhoc"/* or ace-edhoc?, also encoded as a numeric value */,
    docpath="/dns",
    port=61616,
    oauth-aud="dns.example.com",
    oauth-scope="resolve DNS"/* should this be expressed at all? */,
    oauth-as="coap://as.example.com" /* encoded as a CRI? */
